<p><strong>■ Summary of App Data</strong></p>
<p>When you use one of our PlayStation  Apps, information about the app, the device it is installed on and what you do  on it will be collected. We call this information App Data. </p>
<p>We will always collect information  that is needed to run the app. This is known as <strong>Limited Data</strong> and includes the following types of information: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The unique name of your device that the app is running on (like a  long row of numbers and letters) </li>
  <li>Settings that  have been chosen by you on the app (like date, region, language) </li>
  <li>Your internet  connection </li>
  <li>How long it takes to download information to the app (so we know  if something goes wrong and can fix it) </li>
</ul>
<p>Some information will only be  collected if you allow it. This is known as <strong>Full Data</strong>. This includes more detailed information about you such as your  page views and clicks when using the app. </p>
<p>We use the information the app  sends us to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Help us do what you ask us to do. </li>
  <li>Make our apps and  products work better.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Make sure people  follow our rules and the law (so that PlayStation Network is enjoyable and fun  for everyone). </li>
  <li>Help us  understand what our customers like.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Help us to develop new products. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an account for  PlayStation Network, we will add the information your app or device sends us to  the information we already know about you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When a Child Family Account uses  this App, only Limited Data will be collected. </p>
<p>You can find out more about what we  do with the information we collect about you, who we share it with, how you can  control what we do and what your rights are in our Privacy Policy. You can  access our Privacy Policy by visiting www.playstation.com/legal/privacy-policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>■Complete App Data Explanation</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is App Data?</strong></p>
<p>If you use one of our PlayStation  Apps, we may access data from and/or store data on your mobile, tablet, PC  and/or other devices that you are using. </p>
<p>There are two categories of App  Data: </p>
<p><strong>(1) Limited Data</strong></p>
<p>Our servers need to send, receive  and log the following Limited Data that is necessary to deliver our services: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Content Data: Video, audio, graphic, text, game level, account  information, ad and other content that is requested and downloaded for the  features, games, apps and websites you access online or uploaded when you share  such content via the social and communication features of our online services.  If you are playing an online game, this includes all of your online  interactions (such as character movement) as necessary to reflect those  interactions on our game servers. </li>
  <li>Licence Data:  Information about display and interactions with licensed content (such as  videos) as necessary to produce anonymous, aggregate reports to pay licensors  for that content. </li>
  <li>Network Data:  Information about your device&rsquo;s network connections (such as mobile, Ethernet,  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) including IP address and the number, requirements and  speed of the connections. </li>
  <li>Configuration  Data: Information about your device's configuration, such as the manufacturer,  model, number of processors, display size and resolution, date, region,  language, locale and capabilities. </li>
  <li>Connected  Hardware Data: Information about hardware connected to your device, such as  game controllers and other peripherals. </li>
  <li>Error Data: If an  error occurs, the error code and basic data about when and where it occurred.  (An error could indicate a problem that needs fixing.) </li>
  <li>Load Time Data:  Basic information about how long it takes to download and upload content data  to your device. (A long time may indicate a problem.) </li>
  <li>Session and  Diagnostic Data: More detailed navigation information including content and ad  page view, click, impression and video stream data, as well as app/game launch  errors and load times. If strictly necessary to address an issue preventing the  provision of an online service that users have requested, this information may  be associated with account identifiers that are needed to address the issue. </li>
  <li>Security Data:  Information necessary to detect and investigate malicious, unauthorised or  fraudulent activity. </li>
  <li>Legal Data: Information required by applicable law and to  demonstrate compliance. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(2) Full Data</strong></p>
<p>We may also send, receive and log  additional, more detailed information about the configuration of your app, your  mobile, tablet or other device and which software is installed on it. Full Data  may include more detailed information about your page views, clicks,  impressions and video streams. It may also include data about how you use your  app or device when not connected to an online service. (This information is  then uploaded when the ap or device next connects to the internet.) </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<ul>
  <li>If you play one of our games, in addition to necessary online  Limited Data (such as confirming your entitlement to launch the game,  downloading a level and use of our game servers), we may access Full Data about  your interaction with the game. This may include when and how you use the  game&rsquo;s user interface, which parts of the game level you visit, which weapons  you use and which characters you interact with. </li>
  <li>If you visit the  PlayStation Store, in addition to necessary online Limited Data (such as  downloading the Store content and managing your transactions), we may store and  access persistent identifiers on your app or device and more detailed data  about your interaction with the Store interface such as where in each section  you scroll to and which items you hover over. </li>
  <li>If you use one of our apps, in addition to necessary online Full  Data (such as downloading app content from our servers), we may access additional  data about your interaction with the app and your device. This may include your  navigation path through the different parts of the app and how long you spend  looking at different features. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>App Data is usually transmitted to  us and stored with one or more unique network, device and/or account  identifiers. </p>
<p>If you sign in to your account for  PlayStation Network when using a PlayStation system (e.g. PlayStation 4,  PlayStation 5), we may combine App Data with data collected from that system. See  our privacy policy for more details (www.playstation.com/legal/privacy-policy  or via your device settings). </p>
<p><strong>What do the App Data settings control?</strong></p>
<p>The App Data settings allow you to  control which App Data we store and access. You can choose:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited Data: If you choose this setting, only Limited Data will  be accessed and stored. </li>
  <li>Full Data: If you choose this setting, both Limited Data and Full  Data will be accessed and stored. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The App Data settings are only  associated with the device or app they are displayed on and are not associated  with your account for PlayStation Network. You can control the access and  storage of data on each device (e.g. PS4, PS5), app and web browser that you  use independently from the others. </p>
<p><strong>What do we use App Data for?</strong></p>
<p>Limited Data and, if you allow it,  Full Data collection is used as explained in our Privacy Policy  (www.playstation.com/legal/privacy-policy). </p>
<p>This includes use of App Data to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and personalise our online services. </li>
  <li>Produce anonymous  statistics. </li>
  <li>Understand the  performance of your app or device, and to develop improvements and new products  and services. </li>
  <li>Detect,  investigate and minimise malicious, unauthorised or fraudulent behaviour. </li>
  <li>Depending on your  settings, deliver, target and personalise advertising, commercial  recommendations and marketing communications. </li>
  <li>for auditing, compliance and legal purposes (for example, making  or defending claims or activities that are required to comply with law). </li>
</ul>
